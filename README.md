## My Summary

This one definitely challenged my OOP knowledge but really helped me focus on how different objects can interact with each other. This was the first time I didn't follow many tutorials and instead looked at documentation and I feel like I learned a ton! I restarted this a few times before I really got a feel for where classes, folders, etc needed to be located but I feel pretty good about the program layout. Thanks for the review!
